# Under Consideration

This document captures potential gaps and areas for future consideration in the devalbo-core principles and documentation. These are topics that may be relevant to experienced developers new to a project or junior/novice developers, but are not yet formally documented in the core principles.

## Gaps in the Software Development Lifecycle

### 1. **Onboarding & Project Setup** (Critical for new team members)
- Initial project setup instructions
- Environment configuration requirements
- Dependency installation process
- Development environment setup
- First-time contributor guide

### 2. **Version Control & Git Workflow** (Important for collaboration)
- Branching strategy (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, etc.)
- Commit message conventions
- Pull request process and templates
- Code review guidelines
- Merge/rebase policies

### 3. **Code Quality & Standards** (Important for consistency)
- Code style/formatting (ESLint, Prettier configs)
- Naming conventions
- Code organization patterns
- Documentation standards (JSDoc, comments)
- Code review checklist

### 4. **Build & CI/CD** (Critical for deployment)
- Build process and scripts
- Continuous Integration setup
- Continuous Deployment pipeline
- Release process and versioning
- Artifact management

### 5. **Development Workflow** (Important for daily work)
- Local development setup
- Debugging practices
- Hot reloading/development servers
- Environment variables management
- Development vs. production differences

### 6. **Error Handling & Logging** (Important for maintainability)
- Error handling strategies
- Logging practices and levels
- Debugging approaches
- Exception handling patterns

### 7. **Security** (Important for production)
- Security best practices
- Dependency vulnerability management
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Secrets management
- Security review process

### 8. **Dependencies Management** (Important for maintenance)
- How to add/update dependencies
- Version pinning strategy
- Security update process
- Dependency audit practices

### 9. **Documentation Standards** (Important for discoverability)
- Code documentation requirements
- API documentation standards
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- README structure standards
- Inline comment guidelines

### 10. **Sharing and Communication** (File exists but is empty)
- Team communication channels
- Knowledge sharing practices
- Documentation sharing
- Meeting/standup practices
- Decision-making process

### 11. **Refactoring & Technical Debt** (Important for long-term health)
- When to refactor
- Technical debt tracking
- Refactoring guidelines
- Code complexity metrics

### 12. **Monitoring & Observability** (Important for operations)
- Application monitoring
- Metrics collection
- Alerting strategies
- Performance monitoring

### 13. **Performance Considerations** (Important for scalability)
- Performance testing
- Optimization strategies
- Profiling practices
- Performance budgets

## Priority Recommendations

**High Priority** (for both experienced and junior developers):
1. Onboarding & Project Setup
2. Version Control & Git Workflow
3. Build & CI/CD
4. Development Workflow
5. Sharing and Communication (fill the empty file)

**Medium Priority**:
6. Code Quality & Standards
7. Error Handling & Logging
8. Dependencies Management
9. Documentation Standards

**Lower Priority** (but still valuable):
10. Security
11. Refactoring & Technical Debt
12. Monitoring & Observability
13. Performance Considerations
